### Install via bower
`bower install notify-js`

A very simple notification system using jQuery and Bootstrap able to use callbacks

### Demo:
View online [Demo]( http://msroot.github.io/Notify.js/ )

To make it work add a `#notifications` div to your app and style it

```css
#notifications {
	cursor: pointer;
	position: fixed;
	right: 0px;
	z-index: 9999;
	bottom: 0px;
	margin-bottom: 22px;
	margin-right: 15px;
	max-width: 300px;	
}
```


# Params
`:text` the text to be displayed

`:callback`: callback when the user clicks the notification

`:close_callback`: callback for x button

`:style`: `danger`, `warning`, `info`, `success` (default is `warning`)


```js
Notify(text, callback, close_callback, style) 
```
	
## Usage
a simple notification

```js
Notify("Can't Touch This");
```


Notify a `:danger` style message

```js
Notify("Stop! Hammer time", null, null, 'danger');
```

Using callbacks

```js
Notify(
	"I told you homeboy (You can't touch this)",
	function () { 
		alert("clicked notification")
	},
	function () { 
		alert("clicked x")
	}
);
```

## Why?
Because I need a simple library with callbacks and everything its tooooo complicated
